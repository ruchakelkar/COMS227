1 Flowers for Pachyderm, by Mark Strand

3 As Franz Kafka awoke one morning from uneasy dreams, he found himself
4 transformed into a raging bull elephant. He charged around his room with
5 his trunk sticking straight up making loud trumpeting noises. The picture
6 of the lady in furs came crashing down, the vase of anemones tipped over.
7 Suddenly afraid that his family might discover him, Franz stuck his
8 enormous head out of the window overlooking the courtyard. But it was 
9 too late. His parents and sisters had already been awakened by the racket, 
10 and rushed into his room.

12 All of them gasped simultaneously as they stared
13 at the great bulk of Franz's rump. Then Franz pulled his head and 
14 turned toward them, looking sheepish. Finally, after an awkward couple
15 of minutes in which no one spoke, Franz's mother went over and rested her
16 cheek against his trunk and said, Are you ill, dear?  Franz let loose
17 a bloodcurdling blast, and his mother slipped to the floor. Franz's 
18 father was about to help her up but noticed the anemones tipped over
19 on the table. He picked them up and threw them out the window, 
20 saying With Franz like this, who needs anemones?
